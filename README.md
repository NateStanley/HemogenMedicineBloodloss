# Rimworld - Hemogen Medicine Enhanced
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891543191

A standalone version of my other mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891017554]Hemogen Medicine Cures Bloodloss[/url]

Adds a new form of medicine, "Hemogen Medicine" that can be crafted at a Drug Lab.
Hemogen Medicine has special blood related abilities that no other form of medicine has.

[b](NEW)[/b] Adds a new type of craftable hemogen, "Artificial Hemogen Pack"
Requiring the medicine production research, artificial hemogen is produced with raw meat. Consuming it to restore hemogen works... though not as efficiently as the real thing. It also tastes disgusting. It can be used to craft hemogen medicine as well.

[list]
    [*]Whenever you tend a pawn's injuries, and are using Hemogen Medicine, it will treat their bloodloss. *

    [*]A new operation has been added. "Hemogen Medicine Blood Transfusion". This operation treats bloodloss much like a regular transfusion. Due to this being performed with a prepared medical kit though, it's much faster than using just a hemogen pack. This operation also restores Hemogen to Hemogenic individuals. *
[/list] 

[code] * Rates at which Hemogen Medicine treats blood loss may be edited in the mod settings. The default setting matches the treatment rate of vanilla Hemogen Packs [/code]

For hemogen medicine, the recipe simply combines an industrial level medicine with a single hemogen pack. With default setting, this will be able to treat the same amount of blood loss as a normal hemogen pack, though using it during operations makes the tending of bloodloss much quicker. It of course also will treat bloodloss while you tend to pawns other wounds. 

For creating artificial hemogen packs, you must first research medicine production. You can then create it at a drug lab using 100 raw meat. It may take a while, but you'll soon have your disgusting artificial hemogen to do what you want with.


[h1] Use Cases? [/h1]

Of course you are free to use this how you wish, but I made this with a few scenarios in mind!

I feel like the role of a "combat medic" is missing in vanilla RimWorld, especially when you are outside of your colony. There is nowhere to run and take your downed pawns. With hemogen medicine, you're able to treat their bloodloss while in combat without having to retreat to an operating room.



[h1]F.A.Q.[/h1]

[b]Q: My pawn has bloodloss, but I can't tend to him with the hemogen medicine![/b]
A: The way the mod works, is that if you tend a pawn and use the hemogen medicine, it cures the bloodloss (if they have it). Bloodloss is not normally something you can tend to, and this mod does not change that. So to have it fix bloodloss, they need to have something wrong with them (such as a gunshot wound) to tend.

[b]Q: What are the requirements?[/b]
A: The standalone version requires only Harmony & Biotech.

[b]Q: Hemogen Medicine should be more effective than normal hemogen packs![/b]
A: You can adjust the amount of blood loss recovered in the mod settings. The default value is 0.35

[b]Q: Is this compatible with Combat Extended?[/b]
A: I dunno really

[b]dog with afro[/b] created the mod in it's entirety, though this was originally a sub-mod of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2888363855]Azurami's Hemogen Medicine[/url]. I created this mod to create a more functional hemogen medicine that had more a versatile feature set.
