# Rimworld Mod Template

This template is created for Rimworld modders who use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) instead of Visual Studio IDE.

* __No virtual folders__. Easy to manage and edit both `xml` and `cs` files.

* __Lightweight__. Visual Studio Code only takes up to 200 MB of storage space and is lighting fast.

* __Automated__. Integrated build, scripting and management tools to perform common tasks making everyday workflows faster.

* __Customizable__. Almost every feature can be changed, whenever it is editor UI, keybinds or folder structure.

## Setup
1. Download and install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) and [.Net Framework 4.8 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48). This step can be skipped if you already have required C# packages from Visual Studio IDE.
2. Install [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).
3. Clone, pull or download this template into your Rimworld `Mods` folder.

## Additional notes
* By pressing `F5` key VS Code will perform 2 operations: build assembly file and launch Rimworld executable. 
* All intermediate files are kept inside `.vscode` folder.
* For XML only modders remove preLaunchTask line from `.vscode/launch.json` file.
* Modify `.vscode/mod.csproj` and `About/About.xml` according to your needs.
